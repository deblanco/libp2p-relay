# libp2p-relay

This repository contains an experimental implementation of a libp2p relay server. It is designed for research and development purposes only, and should not be used in production environments.

## Overview

The libp2p relay server aims to provide a basic implementation of the libp2p relay protocol, which allows peers to route traffic through intermediary nodes in the libp2p network. This can be useful in scenarios where direct connections between peers are not possible due to firewalls or NAT traversal issues.

This experimental relay server can be used for testing and development of applications that use libp2p as their networking layer. It allows developers to familiarize themselves with the relay protocol and its potential use cases.

Please note that this implementation is not optimized for performance, reliability, or security, and should not be used in production environments.
